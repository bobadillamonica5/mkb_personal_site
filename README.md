# mkb_personal_site
This site describes my background, what I care about, and how I like to spend my time

On the home page, you're learn about who I am and what inspires me.

On the about page, you'll learn about how I spend my time - my hobbies and interests.

On the last page, you'll see things I've built. At this point, there's not much to show in terms of sites I've actually built, but as I progress through this course, there will be more to come!
